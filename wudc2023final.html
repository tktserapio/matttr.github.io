            Argument: These [communities] become less and less good for you and make you less and less happy. 
          </div>

          <div class = "reasoning">
          First, communities tend to impose arbitrary value on you upon birth. They are built up with traditionalist, conservative beliefs that do not fit the worldview of today;
          How do you stop heteronormative standards from being forced down your throat?
          Second, values and beliefs within communities become more malleable on Opp. More people question these things and criticise whether or not they're good.
          <br><br>
          This impact has two immediate outcomes. First, the actual services themselves get better since the pool [of resources] is not done towards harming people but 
          actual good in the first place. Second, people are more receptive to criticism. If you don't feel like this is a critical part of your identity you are more 
          receptive to change within this community because you don't feel like it's an assault on your identity and you don't feel like stagnancy is necessary for 
          stability.
