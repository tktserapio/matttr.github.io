                A "cultural defense" is a defense in criminal trials. It involves the defendant claiming that 
                their actions were motivated by their cultural background and beliefs.

              <p>For the purposes of this debate, there exists a safe technology which can accurately simulate the experience of being in prison. A person within the simulation will experience the simulation as fully real, including time passing slowly as in "real life", while not interacting with others in the "real world". In reality, even a long sentence in the simulation will be done in a matter of days.
