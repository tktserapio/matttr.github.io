              <p>For the purposes of this debate, "fiscal central banking" refers to an economic system that grants central 
                banks the mandate to control circulation of money in the economy through fiscal policy in addition to monetary policy. 
                Under this system central banks can define limitations for the size of the budget, but not its distribution. 
                i.e. they can decide rates for various taxes and limit or increase overall government spending, but can't decide 
                what the money is spent on
