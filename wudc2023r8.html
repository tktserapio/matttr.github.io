            Argument: Why people fear death and how we solve this. 
          </div>

          <div class = "reasoning">
          First, there is a proximate biological fear of death. Second, there is a culture of fear of death spread in society. The last thing is death is painful; more importantly,
          the legacy you leave at the point that you die is terrible, you are not in control of that. You have no control whether or not they remember you as a strong fighter or
          someone who was simply in that bed... <br><br>

          EVEN IF living longer is worse, the comparative is far worse. You probably want to see your friends and family and so they are able to be able to succeed in life, 
          be able to watch out for them. You have the advantage of being able to see all the people's lives so that they have a good life at the end of the day, or they have 
          someone there for them to see them through.
