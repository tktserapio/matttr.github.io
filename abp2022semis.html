            Societies are historically skewed towards telling [gay people] to feel embarrassed and 
            ashamed of yourself. How do we rectify this using out-and-proud, specifically through its prominence? 
          <br><br>
          First, it increases the rate by which we have inspirations to come out. As more people come out, this also includes people of color, 
          people in developing nations, people from religious societies. And that's what allows access to different types of inspirational coming out stories.
          Second, normalization: normalizing integrating into the fact you came out. So it looks like expressing yourself wearing different types of clothing, 
          having PDA with your queer partner. That's where they're most authentic. Third, at the very least, people feel affirmed with themselves. This is crucial 
          because the most vulnerable people in the government will still feel alienated, but it's precisely out and proud that creates 
          the set-up to liberate them.
