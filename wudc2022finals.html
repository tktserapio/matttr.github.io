          One, the US economy is diversified. If you peg against [the dollar], you have inherently less risk. 
          Two, democratic checks and balances. [You're able to] hold politicians accountable and have conversations about how you can best mitigate that 
          crisis, which is why a lot of regulation happened post-2008.
          Three, [even if] this is not true, predictability of the [dollar] is far higher. This is important because currency value is often 
          based on hedging and speculation. You have access to information from a very free floating economy and indices like S&P 500.

          means is when you have promises from Russia or China of really good economic influence in the short term that puts you in power, you as an actor are
          often likely to trade off long-term economic risk because your term would already be over.
