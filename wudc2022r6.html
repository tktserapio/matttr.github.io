            Argument: Why are governments bad and managing the economy in times of crisis.
          </div>

          <div class = "reasoning">
            One, populism within governments. When there's fear of losing jobs, people get very threatened. There's no acceptance of a hard solution.
            Voters don't want to vote away their own job--comparative: central banks are independent tenured people. 
            who therefore don't care about deferring to the populace. Second, short termism in governments. You have 
            frequent elections in government. Policies that help you avoid further inflation or stagnation (e.g. austerity 
            policies), are often things which don't have immediate results. But crucially then, the central bank is
            independent and you're tenured oftentimes so you don't care about your short term of selection. You were already in the job, 
            you were granted going into the future.
