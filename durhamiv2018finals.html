          <div class = "reasoning">
            Why do people commit crimes? The first is crimes of impulse.
            When you are told from a young age that certain ways are what God wants you to act on and that the practices mandate that you act in a 
            certain way means all kinds of impulse therefore are 
            largely derivative of the things that you are taught.
            Then there are crimes in necessity. That belief of condemnation [from God] 
            makes it necessary that you commit that crime in the first place.
            <br><br>
            Cultural defense is essential because the inculcation of practices as you grow up means your autonomy to make choices are constrained. How does this look like?
            One, little agency to leave the particular cultural practice or to not choose it. If you leave, you will be threatened with death by apostasy
            The second is even when you leave and you don’t actively act on your cultural beliefs, the moral frameworks you get from a young age still govern and dictate your decisions. 
            <br><br>
            This the most important consideration in this debate because justice is based on culpability and it is currently failing to account for that.
            The innocent in these particular situations are being penalized
