            Extension 1: The opposition that these movements face is because of the perception that they are Western
          </div>

          <div class = "reasoning">
          Why? Firstly, the West simply has far greater normalization of LGBTQ+ rights (e.g. gay marriage). That is not a priority for post-colonial states 
          who are suffering from things like short-term economic needs. Second, it conflicts with local religion and cultural values, hugely influential in the developing world...
          Fourthly, it is easy to run scare campaigns with footage from the West (e.g. Kink at Pride parades), whipping up moral panics.
          <br><br>
          Such campaigns come from the West, the same West that colonized them, the same West which oppressed them for decades.
          Colonialism is still within the living memory in these developing states. But also, note that nationalism is a 
          widely felt force. Nationalism can be easily directed at a common enemy that is perceived as Western, misaligned with the values of that country. 
          Thus, if you can mitigate that narrative that you are a foreign force, you are far better able to weaken the perception of the movement as a Western force. 
          You are far better able to weaken opposition to that movement.
